# iOS Simulator Crash on Data Fetch in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native application crashes on the iOS simulator when fetching data from a remote server using `fetch`. The application works correctly on Android.

The issue is related to how the `fetch` API handles network requests on iOS, and it highlights the importance of robust error handling when dealing with asynchronous operations.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application on an iOS simulator.
4. Observe the crash.

## Solution

The solution involves using a more robust approach for handling network requests and errors.  The updated code provides a better way to manage these issues and prevents the app from crashing on iOS.
